Python script used to collapse identical DNA sequences in a fasta file. Takes the following two arguments: path to fasta file, and path to output. Fasta headers are preserved for collapsed sequences and delimited by "." (e.g., if SampleName1 and SampleName2 have identical sequences, the collapsed sequence header is SampleName1.SampleName2). If any sequences are collapsed, a list of the collapsed names is printed to stdout (separated by spaces). If no sequences were collapsed, "False" is printed and no file is written. This script was used in the the preparation steps of running RELAX, FEL, BUSTED, and aBSREL from HyPhy.
